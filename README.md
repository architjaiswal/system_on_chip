# system_on_chip
Designed and deployed several IP cores on Altera Cyclon V chip using Intel Quartus Suit and Unix 

Implemented a programmable UART IP module on a Cyclone V FPGA, capable of being controlled and configured from the hard processor subsystem over an Avalon memory-mapped interface. 

Linux kernel modules are also implemented as part of the design
